    "### Semantic kernel Vector Search with chat context/history \n",
    "\n",
    "In previous session, we walked through a simple example based on a fictitious company called Contoso, Ltd. In that example, a employee wanted to simply connect to company's data, retrieve some info, and add a new record.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's consider a different scenario. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume the company has a chatbot that provides below basic support to customers:\n",
    "1. Provide state of shipment\n",
    "2. Provide state of return\n",
    "2. Asking about product info and availability\n",
    "3. Recommend best product based on customer needs\n",
    "\n",
    "For an optimal experience, the chatbot needs to not only access product inventory, sales, shipment and return data, but also it would need to be able to pick up the conversation with each customer where it was left off if required.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this usecase, we are going to introduce and use below semantic kernel capabilities (in addition to what we covered before) to develop a solution:\n",
    "- Chat completion **Agent** to manage the conversation and data access (one agent)\n",
    "- Store and maintain **chat history** per customer and retrieve the history when needed.\n",
    "  -- We will persist the history in **CosmosDB**\n",
    "- Vector search using Semantic Kernel Vector Store connectors\n",
    "  -- Use company data as context to guide the conversation aka **RAG**\n",

      "Text: The Jabra Elite series of headphones, particularly the Jabra Elite 10, are designed to deliver a premium audio experience for both work and leisure. These true wireless earbuds feature a semi-open design with Jabras unique ComfortFit technology, developed from over 62,000 ear scans to ensure a secure, pressure-free fit for all-day wear. The Elite 10 is equipped with 10mm speakers that produce rich, immersive sound, enhanced by Spatial Sound with Dolby Head Tracking for a cinematic audio experience. One of the standout features is the Jabra Advanced Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), which automatically adapts to your environment and is twice as effective as their standard ANC. This makes them ideal for noisy settings like commutes or open offices. For calls, the Elite 10 uses a 6-microphone array with intelligent noise-reduction algorithms that isolate your voice from background chatter, ensuring crystal-clear communication. Battery life is also impressive, offering 6 hours of continuous playback (4 hours with Dolby Head Tracking enabled) and up to 27 hours with the wireless charging case. The earbuds support multi-device connectivity, allowing seamless switching between devices like your phone and laptop. With support for voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa, and a durable build designed for everyday use, the Jabra Elite headphones are a versatile and high-performance choice for users who value comfort, clarity, and convenience.\n",

These headphones feature a **dynamic driver system** with a **40mm diaphragm**, delivering stereo sound with a frequency response range of **20Hz to 20,000Hz**, which ensures clear highs, rich mids, and deep bass. The **200 Ohm impedance** supports high-quality audio output, especially when paired with professional-grade equipment. Built with materials like polyurethane, PVC, polycarbonate, and ABS plastic, the Jabra Studio headphones are both durable and lightweight, weighing approximately **324 grams**. Their **foldable design** enhances portability, making them easy to store and transport. While they are primarily wired for consistent audio transmission and zero latency—crucial in studio settings—they also support **Bluetooth connectivity** for flexible use in less critical scenarios. Additionally, they include **active noise cancellation**, helping to minimise ambient distractions and maintain focus during recording or calls. These headphones are tailored for users who value precision, comfort, and professional-grade performance, making them a solid choice for audio engineers, broadcasters, and remote professionals alike.\n",
